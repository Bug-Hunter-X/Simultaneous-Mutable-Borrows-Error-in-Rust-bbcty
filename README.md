This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving mutable borrows. The `bug.rs` file contains code that will fail to compile due to simultaneous mutable references to the same variable. The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a solution to the problem using different approaches, such as using only one mutable reference or using a different data structure to avoid conflicts.
